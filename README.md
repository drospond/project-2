# Steam Comparison

Are you a Steam user? Do you have friends who own Steam games and want to play together? Steam Comparison is an interactive app where you can enter you and your friends' Steam username, and see if you share a game with your pal!

## Description

Steam Comparison is a Steam API based app that lets users get their games list from Steam and compare their list to that of a friend's list. The application will display both the user list and the list of the other searched individual, also with a third list if matching games are found.
